                    <p>On the occasion of World Milk Day and cow being worshiped in my country, I was curious to know where more cows resided in the world.</p>

                    <p>This led me to search for a dataset from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations website "www.fao.org".</p>

                    <p><b>Which country do you think has more cows?</b></p>

                    <p>So, it turns out that cows reside more in India, followed by China! ( Cows are competing with us!! ;) )</p>

                    <p>Statistics say that, in the year of 2014, total milk animals around the world were 765,916,303.
                    Along with the cow, the statistics include buffalo, camel, goat and sheep as milk animals.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">India, the most milk producing country ?</h2>

                    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
